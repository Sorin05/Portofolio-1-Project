                 <hr>
                 <p>
                    Artisan Bakery opened its doors in February 2018, with a modest selection of pastries and coffees. Since
                    then we have added our own sourdough breads and more pastries to our menu. In August 2019 we won “Bakery
                    of the year” in the Irish Independant Retailer Awards.

                <h2>We care</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We care about our customers and our food. We believe that quality
                    ingredients make quality products. We use Irish flour from Kells for all our pastries and
                    breads, Irish butter from Avonmore.

                <h2>Are you as mad about good bread as we are?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p> Then this offer is for you. 
                    We have started our wholesale business a few months back. 
                    For retail, you’ll have to wait a little longer but if you’re a food producer, restaurateur, café owner in our local area (Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Deansgrange, Dalkey)
                    and you think our bread would be the best for your sandwich menu?! 
                    Or you’d like to serve it to your guests as sourdough bruschetta, please get in touch with us and we’ll be happy to discuss what our business can do for your business.
